  recursive = FALSE, outFile = "outfile.nc", outDir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{dirs}{is the directory where all the files to read are stored}

\item{varname}{name of the variable to extract}

\item{startingString}{string defining the beginning of the netcdf filenames (needed to exclude other files)}

\item{recursive}{logical (TRUE by default). If set to TRUE it looks in folders and subfolders}

\item{outFile}{filename where to store results}

\item{outDir}{is the directory where outFile is saved, by default this is the working directory.}
