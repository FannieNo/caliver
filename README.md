The name '[caliver](https://github.com/ecmwf/caliver)' stands for CALIbration and VERification of gridded model outputs. It is an extension package developed for the R programming language and available with a APACHE-2 license from a public repository.

As the name suggests, the caliver package contains utility functions for the post-processing, calibration and validation/verification of gridded model outputs. Initial test cases include the outputs of the following forest fire models: GEFF and RISICO. However, the algorithms can be applied to any gridded model output.

Complete documentation, including a vignette, is available within the package. Contributions are welcome!

External dependencies
---------------------

The installation of the caliver package depends on the Climate Data Operators ([cdo](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki)), a large tool set for working on climate and NWP model data); the NCAR Command Language ([ncl](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/)), an interpred language with built-in functionalities to convert hdf5 files to netcdf format; the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ([GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats) and the NetCDF4 library ([netcdf4](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)).

Below are the instructions to install caliver's external dependencies on various operating systems.

### Windows

On Windows, follow the steps below:

* install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
* launch an R console and run the following commands: 

### MAC

On MAC, follow the steps below:

* install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the app store.

### Ubuntu-Linux
On Ubuntu-Linux, follow the steps below:

* install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libproj-dev libgdal-dev libhdf5-dev libnetcdf-dev netcdf-bin ncl-ncarg cdo`.


R dependencies
--------------

The caliver package also depends on additional R packages from both CRAN and Bioconductor, here is how to install them from an R console:

``` r
# Install packages from CRAN
packs <- c("rgdal", "ncdf4", "ggplot2", "raster", "sp", "rworldmap", "httr", "stringr", "lubridate", "RCurl", "plotrix", "reshape2", "R.utils", "devtools", "proto", "roxygen2", "png", "rmarkdown", "pkgdown")
install.packages(packs)

# Install package from BIOCONDUCTOR 
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("rhdf5")

# Install packages from GitHub (only needed if you intend to run unit tests)
devtools::install_github("jimhester/covr")
devtools::install_github("jimhester/lintr")
devtools::install_github("MangoTheCat/visualTest")
```

Get caliver's development version from github using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ecmwf/caliver")
```

Load the caliver package:

``` r
library("caliver")
```
