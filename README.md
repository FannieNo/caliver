The name '[caliver](https://github.com/ecmwf/caliver)' stands for CALIbration and VERification of gridded model outputs. It is an extension package developed for the R programming language and available with a GPL-2 license from a public repository.

As the name suggests, the caliver package contains utility functions for the post-processing, calibration and validation/verification of gridded model outputs. Initial test cases include the outputs of the following forest fire models: GEFF (add ref.) and RISICO (add ref.). However, the algorithms can be applied to any gridded model output.

Complete documentation, including a vignette, is available within the package. Contributions are welcome!

Dependencies and Installation
-----------------------------

The installation of the caliver package depends on the Climate Data Operators ([cdo](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki)), a large tool set for working on climate and NWP model data); the NCAR Command Language ([ncl](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/)), an interpred language with built-in functionalities to convert hdf5 files to netcdf format; the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ([GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats); the NetCDF4 library ([netcdf4](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)) and the following R packages:

``` r
packs <- c("rgdal", "ncdf4", "ggplot2", "raster", "sp", "grDevices", "RCurl",
           "rworldmap", "graphics", "httr", "stringr", "lubridate", "rhdf5")
new.packages <- packs[!(packs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

# Install Bioconductor packages
devtools::install_github("Bioconductor-mirror/zlibbioc")
devtools::install_github("Bioconductor-mirror/rhdf5")
```

Get the development version from github using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

``` r
devtools::install_github("ecmwf/caliver")
```

Load the caliver package:

``` r
library("caliver")
```
